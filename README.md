# Spotify Machine Learning Project

This Data Science - Machine Learning project utilizes a Kaggle.com dataset with the most popular songs streamed on Spotify from the past decade and analyzes their features to predict any correlation with their popularity. 

The model should be able to predict the likelihood of a new song hitting top score in popularity based on its attributes, to support business decisions in choosing which songs to air and at what frequency, which in turn results in higher subscriptions and longer streaming time, all resulting in bigger profits for the organization.
